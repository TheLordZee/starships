# Starships At War
Starships At War is a sci-fi strategy game where you gain resources, build spaceships, and  send those ships to do battle against enemy ships to destroy the enemies planet. I built this in a week for the MintBean Hackathon using mainly JavaScript and Phaser. I had never used Phaser before and I learned it on the fly, figuring things out as I needed. I used ships I drew prior to the hackathon so I can focus on the mechanics and getting everything working. 

Music was from Bensound.
## Tech used:
